        <p>I am a PhD student struggling to find meaning in a highly bureacratized world. </p>
        <p><strong>some random  questions:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>What is knowledge?</li> 
            <li>How do we know things?</li>
            <li>How do we know that we know things?</li>
            <li>Do these questions even matter?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>According to Tolstoy, the only question important for us is the following: “What shall we do and how shall we live?” Broadly, I am interested in how philosophical and literary texts – which are often one and the same – provide communities with answers not only to this question of how to live a meaningful life, but also to questions that necessarily follow e.g. What is a meaningful life? Why is it necessary for life to have meaning? I am, therefore, fascinated with the role of language, both Divine and human, in dealing with these concerns: the way it shapes not only responses to existential problems, but the very problems themselves by affecting human self-understanding, and perception of God(s) and the external world. Such questions are the focus of my study of Sufi poetry from the pre- and early-modern Muslim world. In particular, I am interested in the pedagogical elements of this poetry, which provide tools for spiritual and social healing, thereby teaching us how to live meaningfully.</p>
