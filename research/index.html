       <h2>Primary Question:</h2>
        
            <p>
                My dissertation explores pre- and early-modern Sufi poetry in Punjabi, especially the oeuvre of Bulleh Shah (1680-1757), in order to discover tools for spiritual and social healing for contemporary societies.
            </p>

        <h2>Areas of focus: </h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poetry as Pedagogy:</strong>how the ritual of repetition and other elements of poetic form inculcate bodily forms of knowing</li>
                <li><strong>Memory and Authorship:</strong>the relationship of living communities with the poetic personae and the works attributed to them </li>
                <li><strong>Aesthetics of Language:</strong> the role of orality and the relationship between Punjabi language and culture</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Tentative Conclusions:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>Knowing is relational</li>
            <li>Knowing is experiential and embodied (knowing vs. knowledge)</li>
            <li>Knowing has both analytical and synthetic elements</li>
        </ul>
